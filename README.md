**Abstract**

This repository contains all the neccessary files used in my Beta Upgrade Event as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. The topic of my choice was IoT Devices and Time-Series Insights (TSI). Nowadays, there are billions of IoT devices worldwide with many more to come in the near future. These devices collect data that needs to be analyzed in order to take the right decisions. In my event, I demonstrate how to use one of Microsoft Azure's tool, Time-Series Insights (TSI), to ingest and analyze data from csv files.

**Repository Structure**

This repository contains the following files:

1. The "event's slides" outlining the main concepts of the world of Internet of Things (IoT).

2. The "data folder" which contains the data used in the hands-on demo and downloaded from  [[Global Temperature Time Series (here)](https://datahub.io/core/global-temp#resource-monthly)] 

3. The "Python script" that turns our data csv file into JSON objects readable from the Time-Series Insights (TSI) mechanism and sends the JSON objects to the specified Time-Series Insights (TSI).
